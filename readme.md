## Python Exercises:
1. Find the total number of emails in the [emails_exchange-big](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asabeneh/data-science-for-everyone/master/datasets/email_exchanges-big.txt) text file and create a distribution frequency of the email and number of counts. You can call you function, extract_emails.
1. Find the most common [words](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English) in the English language. Call the name of your function find_most_common_words, it will take two parameters which are a string or a file and a positive integer. Your function will return an array of tuples in descending order.
1. Write a function which checks similarity between two texts. You can call your function check_text_similarity. It takes a file or a string a parameter and it will evaluate the similarity of the two texts. For instance check the similarity between the transcripts of [michelle's](https://github.com/Asabeneh/data-science-for-everyone/blob/master/datasets/michelle_obama_speech.txt) and [melina's](https://github.com/Asabeneh/data-science-for-everyone/blob/master/datasets/michelle_obama_speech.txt) speech
2. Develop a program which calculate the measure of central tendency of a sample(mean, median, mode) and measure of variability(range, variance, standard deviation). In addition to those measure, find the min, max, count and frequency distribution of the sample.
3. Find the ten most spoken languages from the [countries](https://github.com/Asabeneh/data-science-for-everyone/blob/master/datasets/countries_data.json) data json file. You can call your function, find_ten_most_spoken_lang.
